# twapy: Temporal Word Analogies in Python

This package is under development. Please check back in July 2017!

This package contains Python code to build and evaluate models for studying temporal word analogies: pairs of words from different points in time that have similar meanings. An example of a temporal word analogy is:

    "Ronald Reagan" in 1987 is like "Bill Clinton" in 1997
    
In this example the strings `'Ronald Reagan'` and `'Bill Clinton'` both represent the semantic concept `president of the United States` at different points in time, and thus they constitute a temporal word analogy.

A discussion of the approach implemented in this package and the types of results it generates will appear at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017). If you use this code, please cite the following paper:
